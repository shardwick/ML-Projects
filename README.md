# ML-Projects

Machine learning and data science projects. 


### NLP: Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques. The model analyzes text data and predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each input. I used techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

### Thermal Processing

Implementing thermal models and numerical solvers from scratch involves a combination of programming languages, development tools, and data management systems.


### Quantitative Research: Trading Metric Science

- Systematic trading strategy utilizing quantitative techniques.
- Risk management and trading metrics to identify inefficiencies.
- Exploring a dataset of market trends and trading metrics to uncover patterns.
