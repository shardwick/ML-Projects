Machine learning and data science projects. 


### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques. The model analyzes text data and predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each input. I used techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve accurate sentiment classification.
