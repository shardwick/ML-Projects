# ML-Projects 

Machine learning and Data Science projects. 


### NLP: Analysis with Natural Language Processing (Sentiment, NLU) 

In this project, I developed a sentiment analysis model using natural language processing techniques. The model analyzes text data and predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with each input. I used techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

### Thermal Processing, CarCalculator, PHEV roadtrip optimizer. 

Implementing thermal models and numerical solvers from scratch involves a combination of programming languages, development tools, and data management systems. Data Management system for single car econometrics. 

### Quantitative Research: Trading Metric Science (Dropout)

Systematic trading strategy utilizing quantitative techniques.
Risk management and trading metrics to identify inefficiencies.
Exploring a dataset of market trends and trading metrics to uncover patterns. 
Algorithmic trades: iterative drops.
